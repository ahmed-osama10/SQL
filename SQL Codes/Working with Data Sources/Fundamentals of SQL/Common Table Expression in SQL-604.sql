## 2. Using a Single CTE ##

WITH
customer_avg_table AS (
 SELECT customer_id, AVG(total) AS total_avg
   FROM invoice
  GROUP BY customer_id 
)

 SELECT c.last_name, c.first_name, i.total_avg
   FROM customer AS c
   JOIN customer_avg_table AS i
     ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id;

## 3. Multiple CTEs ##

WITH
country_invoice_total_table AS (
  SELECT billing_country, SUM(total) AS invoice_total
    FROM invoice
   GROUP BY billing_country
),
country_total_table AS (
  SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS customer_tally
    FROM customer
   GROUP BY country
)
  SELECT ct.country, 
         ROUND(i.invoice_total / ct.customer_tally, 2) AS sale_avg
    FROM country_invoice_total_table  AS i
    JOIN country_total_table AS ct
      ON i.billing_country = ct.country
   ORDER BY sale_avg DESC
   LIMIT 5;

## 4. CTE Constraints ##

WITH
usa_invoice_table AS (
SELECT invoice_id 
  FROM invoice 
 WHERE billing_country = 'USA'
),
invoice_line_track_table AS (
SELECT il.*, t.milliseconds, t.genre_id
  FROM invoice_line il
  JOIN track t
    ON il.track_id = t.track_id
),
usa_track_table AS (
SELECT i.*
  FROM invoice_line_track_table i
  JOIN usa_invoice_table u
    ON i.invoice_id = u.invoice_id
),
metal_genre_table AS (
SELECT genre_id 
  FROM genre 
 WHERE name LIKE '%Metal%'
),
metal_usa_track_table AS (
SELECT *
  FROM usa_track_table u
  JOIN metal_genre_table m
    ON u.genre_id = m.genre_id
)

SELECT invoice_id AS invoice_id, 
       SUM(quantity * unit_price) AS total,
       SUM(milliseconds)/1000.0/60 AS minute
  FROM metal_usa_track_table
 GROUP BY invoice_id;

## 7. Recursive CTEs Anatomy ##

WITH RECURSIVE
managers_chain(employee_id, path) AS (

SELECT employee_id, last_name || ' ' || first_name AS path 
  FROM employee
 WHERE reports_to IS NULL
 
 UNION ALL
 
-- TODO: Write the recursive member here
SELECT e.employee_id, 
       m.path || '<--' || e.last_name || ' ' || e.first_name AS path
  FROM employee e
  JOIN managers_chain m
    ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
 )
 
SELECT path
  FROM managers_chain;
